# Product Pages — Project Portfolio

This repository is a collection of small product-page projects that showcase different design approaches and front-end techniques. It's a personal learning portfolio where each folder is a standalone demo demonstrating progressively more advanced implementations.

## Current focus
- "Water-bottle" — A starter product page built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This is where I'm practicing layout, responsive design, and subtle interactions.

## Future Improvements
- I will continue adding new product-page projects as I learn new tools and frameworks.
- Future projects will include implementations using:
  - Component-based frameworks (React, Vue)
  - CSS frameworks and design systems (Tailwind)
  - Accessibility and performance-focused builds
