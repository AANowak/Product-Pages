## Lessons Learned

Working on this project provided valuable experience in front-end styling and layout techniques. Key takeaways include:

- Improved understanding of CSS grid and flexbox for building responsive and well-structured layouts.  
- Gained practical experience with box styling, including border-radius, box-shadow, and custom framing techniques.  
- Learned how to effectively implement CSS animations using `transform` properties to move and scale elements smoothly.  
- Enhanced skills in using background images and ensuring they integrate seamlessly with responsive designs.  
- Developed strategies for creating text that scales dynamically with flexible containers, improving readability across devices.  

These insights have strengthened my ability to design visually appealing and responsive web interfaces.
